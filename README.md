> Founded in 1994 and originally named Beverly Hills Internet, Geocities was the first mass-use free web hosting service, providing 15MB space to build and customise websites - or homesteads - using WYSIWYG editors and inline HTML. 
>
>By 1997 Geocities had become the 3rd most visited site in the world and contained over 100,000 user-built websites, later growing to 38 million websites. In 1999, it was bought by Yahoo for 3.57 billion dollars during the height of dot-com speculation, and 2 years later, valued at 8 million dollars prior to the dot-com crash of 2000/2001.
>
> For early users of the internet, Geocities was also often the first and only website created. Predominantly North American, the skeumorphic websites of this era often reflect utopian ideals: informal and non-institutional communication, a “[vernacular web](http://contemporary-home-computing.org/vernacular-web-2/)” without “[sickness, death or burial](http://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/)”. 
>
> By the late 2000s however this old world of MIDI and GIFs had come to be seen is a relic, if not embarassment for Yahoo. Talk shifted Web 2.0, signalling a shift toward metadata markets better served by gated platforms and analytics. In 2009, Yahoo announced it would be removing Geocities from the internet.
>
> Pre-empting this change, archivists organised to preserve Geocities: at first with attempted cooperation from Yahoo, then via scripted bots. Partially scraped in it’s entirety, resources include the [Archive Team torrent](https://thepiratebay.org/description.php?id=5923737), and online mirrors such as [Geocities Archive Project](http://geocities.ws/archive/), Retrocities, [Oocities](https://www.oocities.org) and Internet Archaeology. Here it is possible to discover many thousands of user-created digital epitaphs and memorials. 
>
> The sites reproduced here reflect popular internet use at the turn of the millenium, and in many, an assumption by their creators of a permanent epitaph in an otherwise impermanent world. 
>
> In digital life there are perhaps many approximations of death and burial, and also desecration.
